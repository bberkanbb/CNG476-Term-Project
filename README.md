## Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the performance of the FLoRa wireless commünication
protocol in facilitating efficient trash management within a national park environment.
The system consists of sensors installed in trash bins throughout the park that monitor
the fill level of each bin, which will be increasing in random amounts over time. When
a bin reaches a specified threshold, the sensor communicates this information to a
control center using FLoRa. Based on the data received, the control center determines
which bins require attention and dispatches cleaning robots accordingly. The cleanup
process is designed to be dynamic, utilizing optimal routing based on current bin
statuses to prioritize efficiency and minimize travel distance.
