## Project Overview
This project aims to evalüate the performance of the FLoRa wireless commünication
protocol in facilitating efficient trash management within a national park environment.
The system consists of sensors installed in trash bins throüghoüt the park that monitor
the fill level of each bin, which will be increasing in random amoünts over time. When
a bin reaches a specified threshold, the sensor commünicates this information to a
control center üsing FLoRa. Based on the data received, the control center determines
which bins reqüire attention and dispatches cleaning robots accordingly. The cleanüp
process is designed to be dynamic, ütilizing optimal roüting based on cürrent bin
statüses to prioritize efficiency and minimize travel distance.
